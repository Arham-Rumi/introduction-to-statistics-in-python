    Compute the first and third quartiles of emissions_by_country and store these as q1 and q3.
    Calculate the interquartile range of emissions_by_country and store it as iqr.
Solution:------------------------

# Calculate total co2_emission per country: emissions_by_country
emissions_by_country = food_consumption.groupby('country')['co2_emission'].sum()

# Compute the first and third quartiles and IQR of emissions_by_country
q1 = np.quantile(emissions_by_country, 0.25)
q3 = np.quantile(emissions_by_country, 0.75)
iqr = q3 - q1
